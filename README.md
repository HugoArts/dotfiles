Dotfiles
========

How I manage my dotfiles. This one is set up to leave your home directory as
clean as possible by utilizing the XDG directory specification as much as I
can.

## Installing

just clone wherever you want, then run the `install.py` script. You can run it
with `--dry-run` first to see what will be happening. The script doesn't delete
any existing files but moves them instead to a backup dir.
